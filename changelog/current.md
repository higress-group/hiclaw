- fix(manager): allow unstable room versions in Tuwunel to fix room version 11 error
- feat(manager): reduce default context windows (qwen3.5-plus: 960k→200k, unknown models: 200k→150k) and support `--context-window` override for unknown models in model-switch skills
- feat(manager): switch group session reset from idle (2880min) to daily at 04:00, matching DM sessions; remove keepalive mechanism (session-keepalive.sh, notify-admin-keepalive.sh, HEARTBEAT step 7, AGENTS.md keepalive response section)
- feat(copaw): buffer non-mentioned group messages as history context with `[Chat messages since your last reply - for context]` / `[Current message - respond to this]` markers (matching OpenClaw convention); download images for history when vision is enabled; bridge `historyLimit` config ([7eec4a5](https://github.com/higress-group/hiclaw/commit/7eec4a5))

- chore(copaw): use registry mirror for Python base image in Dockerfile; bump copaw-worker to 0.1.2 ([7eec4a5](https://github.com/higress-group/hiclaw/commit/7eec4a5))
