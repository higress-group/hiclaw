# Changelog (Unreleased)

Record image-affecting changes to `manager/`, `worker/`, `openclaw-base/` here before the next release.

---

- fix: set container timezone from TZ env var in both Manager and Worker (install tzdata in base image, configure /etc/localtime and /etc/timezone at startup)
- feat(manager): add User-Agent header (HiClaw/<version>) to default AI route via headerControl, and send it in LLM connectivity tests ([3242d06](https://github.com/higress-group/hiclaw/commit/3242d0630d196c35b5df6fd6fbd7ac6e6b72c08a))
- feat(openclaw-base): install cron package in base image, start crond in Manager (supervisord) and Worker (entrypoint)
- feat(manager): add `--runtime copaw` support to `create-worker.sh`; copaw workers are pip-installed Python processes (not containers), registry tracks `runtime` field, lifecycle scripts skip copaw workers automatically
- feat(copaw): add `copaw/` package — HiClaw's CoPaw Worker runtime (`copaw-worker` CLI) that bridges openclaw.json → CoPaw config, implements MatrixChannel, and syncs config from MinIO
- fix(manager): copaw install command now uses `HICLAW_PORT_GATEWAY` (external port) instead of internal `:8080` so the command works on the host machine
- feat(copaw): add optional `--console-port` to copaw-worker; headless mode saves ~500MB RAM; startup prints memory tip in both cases; SKILL.md and create-worker.sh updated accordingly
- fix(copaw): fix MatrixChannel not mentioning sender in replies (missing `sender_id` in meta payload caused manager to ignore worker replies)
- feat(copaw): sync skills from MinIO on startup (`_sync_skills`)
- feat(copaw): rewrite `sync.py` to use mc CLI for all MinIO operations (mc cat, mc ls, mc alias set); remove httpx + AWS Signature V4 implementation
- feat(copaw): add CoPaw-specific file-sync skill (`manager/agent/copaw-worker-agent/skills/file-sync/`) with `copaw-sync.py` script for manual sync trigger; `create-worker.sh` selects runtime-specific file-sync skill from `/opt/hiclaw/agent/copaw-worker-agent/` for copaw runtime
